Summary:  
This project explores dimensionality reduction techniques for high-dimensional gene expression data. We applied **Isomap** to preserve global manifold structure  and **t-SNE** to reveal local clusteringpatterns.The results show that the data lies on a **complex, curved manifold**, making classification challenging due to   overlapping categories. Isomap highlights the global geometry, while t-SNE emphasizes local group separations, providing complementary insights into the dataset.
